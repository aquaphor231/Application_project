# Application_project

Hello! My name is Blessing Adomakoh, and this is my first website ever! It is a personal website. I tried to make it as all-encompassing as possible. What interesting things about me do I want to share that have made an impact on who I am now as well as in relation to my early computer science career?

I spent a total of about 30 hours on this project. I have never used html or css before, so there was a lot of trial and error, a lot of watching youtube videos, google searches, and playing around with what I found to make it reflect what I wanted my first personal website to look like. I changed the colors a lot to make it one that felt right. There was a lot of making minor changes to positioning and spacing to make sure it looked right. I wanted to make my pictures look like polaroids with captions, so I also had to figure out how to implement that. I wanted my fonts to be very readable so I took into account fonts that were not difficult to read. I persisted in adding flexboxes to make my website responsive, which was by far the toughest part as the resources provided did not always translate exactly; I had to figure out how to make what I learned unique to my website. All in all, there were many unforeseen mistakes that I definitely learned from. (Key takeaways: Avoid "position: absolute;" for positioning and mass restructuring purposes. And do not include periods in class names). 

The features I included were:
- [ x ] Flexbox
- [ x ] Header
- [ x ] Resume Button (non-functional)
- [ x ] B logo in main header(for Blessing)
[ x ] Linear Gradient Background Color
[ x ] Font changes ("Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace throughout and 'Shadows Into Light', cursive for the polaroid captions)
[ x ] Navigation bar that's linked to specific parts on the page with slowed transitions for a smoother navigation
[ x ] Hover Effects (makes it more readable for users)
[ x ] Social Media Handles with Icons (linkedin icon linked to my profile)
[ x ] Images (made to look like polaroid with white background and some positioning)
[ x ] Embedded videos
[ x ] Box Shadowing
[ x ] Portfolio of past projects (personal and assignments)
[ x ] Letter Shadowing in the names in my portfolio
[ x ] Horizontal lines as separators for organization

Accessible features include:
- Light/Dark Mode
- Image Alt Text
- Sequential heading structure
